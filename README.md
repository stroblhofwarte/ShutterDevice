A simple automated cap to cover the telescope lense for an automated dark frame process. 
This cap is controlled as filterwheel with two positions (open,close) via an INDI driver.

This repo contains the sources for the INDI Filter Wheel driver and the WEMOS D1 mini firmware 
controling the small servo to close and open the cap.
